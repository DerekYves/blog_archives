Welcome to my blog! I'm the Senior Data Scientist at Church Pension Group in New York, NY. 
My professional background is fairly eclectic. Before joining CPG I worked in survey research, statistical analysis, hospital chaplaincy, and even as an auto mechanic.
I enjoy cycling, running, and of course codin' in R. 

This fall my coauthored book [Agents of Neoliberal Globalization](https://books.google.com/books/about/Agents_of_Neoliberal_Globalization.html?id=kc5urgEACAAJ) is coming out with [Cambridge University Press](http://www.cambridge.org).
