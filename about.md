About Derek Darves:


I'm the Senior Data Scientist at Church Pension Group in New York, NY. 
My professional background is fairly eclectic, and includes periods of survey research, statistical analysis, hospital chaplaincy, and auto repair.
I enjoy cycling, running, and, of course, codin' in R. 

This fall my coauthored book [Agents of Neoliberal Globalization](https://books.google.com/books/about/Agents_of_Neoliberal_Globalization.html?id=kc5urgEACAAJ) is coming out with [Cambridge University Press](http://www.cambridge.org).
